Processor Information Application
This is an application with a webpage and a thin client.

You can access information about processors and, if you register using traditional e-mail (with 2FA) or Facebook/Microsoft social providers, you can add new processors as well as view the already published ones.

Features
User Registration: Register using email or social providers. Upload a profile picture upon registration.
Password Management: Request a password reminder or a new password.
GDPR Compliance: Download all your data and delete your account.
Admin Capabilities: Remove processors and edit processor details to keep the page up to date.
The application is hosted in Azure, and photos are stored using Blob storage. For keeping modifications in sync, SignalR is used.
